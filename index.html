                I love coding and technology, and I’m looking forward to learning more, growing my skills, 
                and exploring the tech world as a proud tech girl.

            <h3>Latest Project</h3>
            <p>
                My latest project is a “Women in Tech Resource Hub,” a mini website celebrating inspiring women in technology. 
                It features profiles, motivational quotes, and helpful resources for anyone starting their tech journey. 
                I built it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a colorful, user-friendly design.
