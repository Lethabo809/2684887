In this lab, I learned how to use semantic HTML5 to organize a webpage in a clear way. I practiced using elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, and <footer> to separate different parts of the page. I also made a navigation menu and figured out how to tell sections and articles apart for different types of content. Building my portfolio helped me see how to show personal info and projects in a way that’s easy to read and use. Overall, I realized that semantic HTML makes a page better and easier to read and understand.
